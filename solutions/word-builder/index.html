    //1. Create function named wordBuilder, and prepare it to recieve one argument, the value of string wordToSpell.
    //2. Within the function, define a new variable, an empty string named word which will hold characters of wordToSpell.
    //3. Within the function, define an empty array literal, which will store the character chunks of wordToSpell as it is being built.
    //4. Create a for loop which will iterate through the charcters of string wordtoSpell, and add each character to the variable word.
    //5. The variable word will then be pushed into the new array, and the array will be returned out of the function.
